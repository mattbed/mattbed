### About me!
Hi!
I've had a lifelong interest in coding, going back to fiddling in qbasic on my first computer in elementary school. This developed into a hobby, and stayed that way throughout a career in the graphics industry followed by a temporary career in retail management while I tried to figure out what new career path to pursue. Once I realized that I had a perfectly good hobby that I could turn into a career path right in front of me, I signed up for a web development bootcamp with Lighthouse Labs and now I am one diploma richer, and ready for the next step!

### Current goals

- Expand on my knowledge of React
  - Learn Redux
  - Learn AngularJS
  - Learn Vue.js
- Expand on my knowledge of Algorithms within JavaScript
